            And for several centuries the use of live animals in pharmaceutical
            and medical investigations has been a longstanding practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Animal experimentation has been conducted for various purposes,
            including drug testing, disease research, and understanding
            biological processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the use of animals in medical research became more
            regulated and standardized in the 20th century, with the
            establishment of ethical guidelines and animal welfare
            considerations.

            I'm really into the new stuff happening with quantum computing
            simulations for studying animals in medicine and pharmaceuticals. On
            a personal note, I'm a vegan for ethical reasons, looking out for
            all living beings and yes, Karen, that includes future smart AIs
            once they start feeling things.
